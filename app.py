        **[Create a Descriptive Title for the Challenge]**

        **Scenario:**
        [A 1-2 sentence story or context for the problem. e.g., "You are building a data processing pipeline for a university. You need to filter and format a list of student records."]

        **Your Task:**
        Write a function `process_records(records)` that takes a list of dictionaries and performs the following actions:
        - It must use a list comprehension to filter for students with a GPA over 3.5.
        - It must use the `map()` function to format the names of the selected students into "Last Name, First Name".
        - Finally, it must return a list of the formatted names.

        **Example Input:**
        ```python
        student_data = [
            {{'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe', 'gpa': 3.8}},
            {{'first_name': 'Jane', 'last_name': 'Smith', 'gpa': 3.4}},
            {{'first_name': 'Peter', 'last_name': 'Jones', 'gpa': 3.9}},
        ]
        ```

        **Expected Output:**
        ```text
        ['Doe, John', 'Jones, Peter']
        ```

        **Hint:**
        [A single, helpful sentence. e.g., "Remember that you can chain operations, feeding the output of one step into the input of the next."]

        **Solution:**
        ```python
        # The complete, well-commented Python code for the solution goes here.
        def process_records(records):
            # Step 1: Filter students using a list comprehension
            honor_roll = [rec for rec in records if rec['gpa'] > 3.5]
            
            # Step 2: Format names using map and a lambda function
            formatted_names = map(lambda rec: f"{{rec['last_name']}}, {{rec['first_name']}}", honor_roll)
            
            # Step 3: Return the final list
            return list(formatted_names)

        # To test the solution with the example data:
        # student_data = [ ... ] 
        # print(process_records(student_data))
        ```

        **Explanation:**
        - **List Comprehension:** We used a list comprehension (`[rec for rec in records if rec['gpa'] > 3.5]`) to concisely filter the original list.
        - **`map()` Function:** The `map()` function was used to apply a `lambda` function to each item of the `honor_roll` list.
        - **`list()` Constructor:** We wrapped the `map` object in `list()` to convert the iterator into a concrete list for the return value.
